*Firstly,grammarly,’adequate’ could not use before the noun in the plural(名词复数),but the others can*

*Secondly,*

​	*'Adequate' refers barely enough,just enough,nothing remain except we need*

​	*’Sufficent’ means remain a little bit except we need*

​	*‘Enough’ means a quite amount remain except we need*
